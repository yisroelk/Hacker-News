delta_p_delta_x,41022966,41021366,"The moment I read &#x27;it is a <i>content update</i> that causes the BSOD, deleting it solves the problem&#x27;, I was immediately willing to bet a hundred quid (for the non-British, that&#x27;s £100) that it was a combination of said bad binary data and a poorly-written parser that didn&#x27;t error out correctly upon reading invalid data (in this case, read an array of pointers, didn&#x27;t verify that all of them were both non-null and pointed to valid data&#x2F;code).<p>In the past ten years or so of having done somewhat serious computing and zero cybersecurity whatsoever, I have my mind concluded, feel free to disagree.<p>Approximately <i>100%</i> of CVEs, crashes, bugs, slowdowns, and pain points of computing have to do with various forms of deserialising binary data back into machine-readable data structures. All because a) human programmers forget to account for edge cases, and b) imperative programming languages allow us to do so.<p>This includes everything from: decompression algorithms; font outline readers; image, video, and audio parsers; video game data parsers; XML and HTML parsers; the various certificate&#x2F;signature&#x2F;key parsers in OpenSSL (and derivatives); and now, this CrowdStrike content parser in its EDR program.<p>That wager stands, by the way, and I&#x27;m happy to up the ante by £50 to account for my second theory.",1721543911,comment,"[41023295, 41023371, 41023398, 41023395]",
hatsunearu,41023440,41021366,"I see a paradox that the null bytes are &quot;not related&quot; to the current situation and yet deleting the file seems to cure the issue. Perhaps the CS official statement that &quot;This is not related to null bytes contained within Channel File 291 or any other Channel File.&quot; is poorly worded.<p>My opinion is that CS is trying to say the null bytes themselves aren&#x27;t the actual root cause of the issue, but merely a trigger for the actual root cause, which is that CSAgent.sys has a problem where malformed input vectors can cause it to crash. Well designed programs should error out gracefully for foreseeable errors, like corrupted config files.<p>If we interpret that quoted sentence such that &quot;this&quot; is referring to &quot;the logical error&quot;, and that &quot;the logical error&quot; is the error in CSAgent.sys that causes it to crash upon reading a bad channel file, then that statement makes sense.<p>This is a bit of a stretch, but so far my impression with CS corporate communication regarding this issue has been nothing but abject chaos, so this is totally on-brand for them.",1721550399,comment,,

G3rn0ti,41022728,41021366,By-passing the discussion whether one actually needs root kit powered endpoint surveillance software such as CS perhaps an open-source solution would be a killer to move this whole sector to more ethical standards. So the main tool would be open source and it would be transparent what it does exactly and that it is free of backdoors or really bad bugs. It could be audited by the public. On the other hand it could still be a business model to supply malware signatures as a security team feeding this system.,1721541040,comment,"[41022886, 41022991, 41022937]",
